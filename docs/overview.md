# Corti — Project Overview

## Vision

Build an open-source Python memory framework where **AI agents' long-term memory is plain Markdown files on the user's disk**, not opaque rows in a hosted database.

## Scope

**In scope (v1)**:

- Local deployment for personal agents or small teams
- Conversation, workflow, agent-trace, file-knowledge → structured memory
- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + vector + scalar filter)
- Cascade index sync (md edit → Postgres sub-second)
- Dual-track memory (user-track / agent-track)
- Offline memory evolution (Foresight / AtomicFact / Profile / Skill),
  including Reflection — a consolidation strategy within the OME that
  merges + re-extracts related episodes
- Knowledge base (document upload, parse, CRUD, semantic search)
- CLI + HTTP API

**Out of scope (v1, future v2)**:

- Multi-tenant / group / community deployment (10K+ users)
- End-to-cloud sync (planned for v2)
- Distributed deployment / sharding

## Design philosophy

### 1. Markdown as Source of Truth

```
delete all Postgres / SQLite files → can rebuild from md
delete any md file               → memory is gone
```

User trust comes from physical visibility — the user can `cat` / `vim` / `grep` their own memory at any time.

### 2. Three-piece storage with clear job boundaries

| Component | Role | Does NOT do |
|---|---|---|
| Markdown files | Truth source — entries, frontmatter | Search (grep is degraded fallback only) |
| SQLite | Queue, cascade audit log, sensitive data isolation | Vector / full-text |
| Postgres | Vector ANN + BM25 + scalar filter, single-query hybrid | Be the source of truth (loss = rebuild from md) |

### 3. Algorithm-orchestration separation

`everalgo` (vendored under `src/everalgo/`; formerly published as separate
packages `everalgo-user-memory` / `-agent-memory` / `-rank` / `-knowledge`)
holds the extraction algorithms (memory-cell extraction, episode generation,
profile evolution). Corti calls everalgo's extractor functions directly —
passing storage-free data in, getting structured results out; for a couple
of extractors (episode and boundary detection) it can override the bundled
prompt via the PromptSlot mechanism. everalgo knows nothing about storage.

This boundary lets the same algorithm power both this open-source lightweight version and other product forms.

### 4. DDD layered architecture

```
entrypoints  →  service  →  memory  →  infra
                              ↓
                        component / core / config
```

Strict single-direction dependency, enforced by `import-linter` in CI.

## Why src layout (`src/corti/`)

- Standard src-layout project structure — the working tree stays off the import path until installed
- Avoid namespace collision with system packages named `memory`, `infra`, etc.
- Avoid accidental import of working-tree code in dev (standard Python packaging recommendation)

## Comparable projects (where Corti differs)

| Project | Position | Difference |
|---|---|---|
| [mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) | API-first memory service | mem0 stores in vector DB; we store in md files |
| [Letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta) | Agent OS w/ Core/Recall/Archival | Letta uses Postgres; we use markdown filesystem |
| [MemOS](https://github.com/MemTensor/MemOS) | Multi-classification memory | MemOS targets enterprise; we target lightweight (single-user / small team) |
| [memsearch](https://github.com/zilliztech/memsearch) | md-first search engine | Closest to us; we add memory extraction (not just search) |

## Roadmap

- **v0.1 (MVP)** — Phase 1 core loop: markdown + postgres + cascade + episode extraction
- **v0.2** — Full extraction pipeline (workspace / agent / knowledge), evolution framework
- **v0.3** — Production hardening, full CLI, HTTP API, Obsidian demo
- **v1.0** — Stable API, comprehensive docs
- **v1.1** — Knowledge base + Reflection (offline memory consolidation)
- **v2** (future) — Edge-to-cloud sync via EverMe (separate project)

## Status

**Latest stable release: v0.3.4** — memory policy served from the server, thin runtime adapters; see [releases](https://github.com/pgmi-builds/corti/releases).
